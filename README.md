Cpp dev (might write something in python also)

## What I did

Worked at Embedded Systems at Yandex as intern, participated
in university-curated project Laar (also Embedded), developed daemon
for processing and controlling raw sound samples on device.

## What I am learning

I study as CyberSec specialist at HSE in Russia. I know some
things about modern cryptography, basic webapp attacks and network stack, learning
design patterns, trying to have extensive view on different
fields where I can create software with my stack.

## What I know

- multithreading
- - multithreaded application design
- - threaded workers: thread pools and synchronized queues
- - synchronization primitives: mutexes, condition variables, atomics etc.
- - common problems: races, deadlocks, proper thread termination
- memory management
- - smart pointers, how to use them and what to fear
- design patterns
- - basic design patterns: factory methods, singletons and interfaces
- - rare patterns: prototyping, adapters, facades...
- English 
- - C1
- workflow
- - VCS: git primarily
- - PRs, reviewing and keeping repo clean
- - Unit tests: how to write them
- - debugging: gcd, core dumps
- - proper logging
- OOP
- - class members, methods, access and static qualifiers
- - virtual members and pure abstract classes
- - inheritance

## What I use

- C/C++, primarily C++17, slowly learning 20
- CMake, although looking for trying something different
- Python, had some projects with it

## What I like

- Embedded systems and applied projects on cpp
- clean and styled code, patterns (especially interfaces)

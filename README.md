Cpp dev

## What I did

Worked at Embedded Systems at Yandex as intern, participated
in university-curated project Laar (also Embedded), developed daemon
for processing and controlling raw sound samples on device.

## What I am learning

I study as CyberSec specialist at HSE in Russia. I know some
things about modern cryptography, webapp attacks and network stack, learning
design patterns, trying to have extensive view on different
fields where I can create software with my stack.

## What I know

- multithreading: primitives, design and possible problems
- memory management: smart pointers and their neat parts
- design patterns: interfaces, factories, singletons and others
- English: C1 (guess why I write this in English?)
- workflow: familiar with VCS, creating and reviewing PRs, tests, automation (basic DevOps)
- OOP: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and everything that Cpp throws with these

## What I use

- C/C++, primarily C++17, learning 20
- CMake, although eager to try other build systems
- Python, my second love

## What I like

- Embedded systems and applied projects on cpp
- clean and styled code, interfaces
- spiders ðŸ•·
